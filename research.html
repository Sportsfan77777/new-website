						<p>The Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-mm Array (ALMA) has revolutionized the field of planet formation with its amazing capability to take good images of nearby protoplanetary disks! (Most of the closest ones are 140 to 160 pc away.) <b>What would you expect these disks to look like?</b> You might expect something like the figure below on the left: a disk that fades far from the star, that also has some rings and gaps, and that the gaps might contain planets. <b>The feature you would probably take most for granted is that the disk is axisymmetric. However, not all disks we have imaged have that last, <i>most obivous</i> feature.</b></p>

				          <i><strong>Left:</strong> AS 209, a normal axisymmetric disk highlighted by rings and gaps (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...869L..48G/abstract">Guzmán+ 2018</a>). <strong>Right:</strong> HD 135344B, an unusual asymmetric disk with a large crescent-shaped feature that stands out the most (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...619A.161C/abstract">Cazzoletti+ 2018</a>).</i>
				        </font></center></p>

				        <p>What is causing the crescent-shaped feature above on the right? How about a planet? As the movie below on the left shows, placing <b>a Jupiter-mass planet in a smooth disk will create</b> a gap in the disk. If the disk has sufficiently low viscosity, it will become unstable. The instability manifests as a series of small co-orbital vortices. In time, these vortices will merge into <b>one big vortex that looks like the crescent in HD 135344B</b> at the beginning. This vortex survives several thousand planet orbits, thereby providing a suitable explanation for that crescent (according to previous work).</p>

				    	<p>But wait a minute: <b>How could you ever have a fully-grown Jupiter-mass planet in a smooth disk with no gap?</b> After reasoning that doesn't make sense for planets that formed through core accretion, <b>we tried introducing the planet more slowly</b> over a timescale of several hundred to a few thousand orbits (see the movie above on the right for an example). We found that the vortex is much weaker in two very noticeable ways! First, <b>the vortex lifetime is much shorter</b> (by 80% in the two movies shown above!). Second, <b>the vortex is much more elongated</b> (with an azimuthal extent of 240 degrees, instead of 120 degrees with rapid growth!). In some cases with higher viscosity than shown in the movies above, the slower growth inhibits the formation of vortices altogether!</p>

				    	<p>The figures above show how vortex lifetimes get shorter (left) and vortex extents get wider (right) with longer growth timescales. For the cases where vortices are much wider, do they look different from the normal, more compact vortices in observations of the dust too? To understand that, you'll have to check out my next paper (see the next section)!</p>

				    	<p><i><b>Bonus:</b> Why does the disk become unstable and form vortices?</i></p>
				    	<p element style="margin-top:-20px"><i>Imagine having a denser fluid on top of a less dense fluid (like vinegar on top of oil, or if the Earth's atmosphere were denser at the top instead of the bottom). That would be unstable! The denser fluid would have to sink down until the less dense fluid ends up on top. This scenario can occur in protoplanetary discs too: When a planet that opens up a gap, the disk is denser at the outer gap edge compared to inside the gap. Hence, the denser material should fall into the gap towards the star, right?</i></p>
				    	<p element style="margin-top:-25px"><i>Actually, there is one major caveat preventing that from happening: <b>The disk rotates!</b> The disk's rotation stabilizes it against the layers simply sinking towards the star. Although that doesn't happen, the rotation of the disk allows another instability to occur: the Rossby wave instability.</i></p>
				    	<p element style="margin-top:-25px"><i>At sharp density gradients in the disk (really, gradients in vortensity), the Coriolis force acts as a restoring force for Rossby waves to form. At each gap edge, there are two Rossby waves: one at the inner side of the gap edge moving at a super-Keplerian rate, and another at the outer side moving at a sub-Keplerian rate. There is just one problem: Rossby waves are transverse!</i></p>
				    	<p element style="margin-top:-25px"><i>Each of the two Rossby waves at a gap edge wants to move in opposite directions. With the transverse nature of the waves though, they have a width in the radial direction. If the waves are too close together (i.e. the bump is too sharp), the inner wave is pulling that material in the center of the bump to move faster than the Keplerian velocity, while the outer wave is pulling it back to move slower than the Keplerian velocity. Which direction should the material in-between the waves move?</i></p>
				    	<p element style="margin-top:-25px"><i>The answer is both directions! The material gets sped up by the inner wave, before being slowed down by the outer wave. In the end, the material swirls up and forms a vortex. Because the high-numbered modes (m = 3 to 5) of the Rossby waves are stronger at sharper gradients, the RWI typically forms multiple co-orbital vortices (3 to 5). As these smaller vortices continue to grow, they eventually overlap and merge into one big vortex.</i></p>

						<p>The previous section showed that elongated vortices induced by slowly-grown planets look different from concentrated vortices induced by rapidly-grown planets in the gas. But what about the dust, the component that is observed by ALMA? Naively, you might think the answer is no. <b>Vortices trap dust at the center regardless of their shapes, right? As it turns out, you would be wrong.</b> The figure below shows why.</p>

				        </font></center></p>

				        <p>Above, you can see that the elongated vortex (right) lacks a vorticity minimum and a series of smooth elliptical contours, the two main features of a concentrated vortex (left) that make it straightfoward for the vortex to trap dust in its center. Instead, <b>the elongated vortex has a much flatter pressure bump across the majority of the vortex. As a result, it doesn't have a reason to trap dust at its center.</b> Where does the dust go instead?</p>

				        <p>As the figure and movie above both show, the elongated vortex still easily traps dust. But instead of ending up at the center, <b>the dust <i>circulates</i> around the vortex!</b> As a result, elongated vortices are just about as elongated in the dust as they are in the gas. Another key signature of these vortices is that <b>the peak dust concentration is typically located off-center</b>, often by more than 30 degrees! Below, let's compare synthetic images of both concentrated and elongated vortices to the ALMA image of HD 135344B at the top of the page.</p>

				        <center>

				        </font></center></p>

						<p>The image on the right above does a better job at reproducing the elongated extent of the crescent in HD 13544B. Unlike the concentrated vortex, it also has an off-center peak, just like the crescent from that real ALMA image. These two signatures make the asymmetry in HD 13544B an excellent elongated planet-induced vortex candidate.</p>

				        <p><i><b>Bonus:</b> What beam diameter do I need to detect signatures of elongated vortices?</i></p>
				    	<p element style="margin-top:-20px"><i>That's a good question. The figure below shows a comparison of synthetic images of the same snapshot of an elongated vortex with three different beam sizes: half the planet's semimajor axis, equal to the planet's semimajor axis, and one and a half times the planet's semimajor axis (equivalent to about the vortex's semimajor axis). The first two beam sizes seem sufficient for a face-on disk, while the last one is not good enough. (That statement is quantified in the paper.)</i></p>

						<p>One of the key results of our first paper was that realistic planet growth times; however, we only tested out planets more massive than Jupiter and disks with one specific scale height. Which planets trigger longer-lived vortices: low-mass or high-mass? Naively, you would think more massive planets create sharp bumps, which should lead to stronger longer-lived vortices, right? Well, it's not that simple.</p>

				          <i><strong>Left:</strong> The total lifetimes based on the dust, as a function of three main parameters: planet mass, disk scale height, and disc viscosity. With a low viscosity, low-mass planets are accompanied by vortices for much longer!<br>
				          <strong>Right:</strong> The lifetimes of the initial vortices based on the gas in the low viscosity cases, as a function of two parameters: planet mass and disc mass. With a high disc mass, the initial vortex lifetime only depends on scale height, not planet mass.
				          </i>
				        </font></center></p>

				        <p>Above, you can see that the total vortex lifetimes are longer for lower-mass planets, even though the lifetimes of the initial vortices do not depend on the planet mass. What is going on? These patterns occur for a few separate reasons. First, in the low viscosity cases, shocks are responsible for killing each vortex. The strength of the shocks increases with higher Mach numbers, hence vortices in discs with low scale height decay much faster while vortices in discs with very high scale heights seemingly never decay.</p> 

				        <p>Yet, some of the total lifetimes in the low scale height cases are longer than others. Why? With lower-mass planets, the vortex can re-form, as you can see below with a sub-Saturn-mass planet!</p>

				          </i>
				        </font></center></p>

				        <p>As the density movie shows, the vortex re-forms three times (at t = 2600, 3150, and 3660 orbits). Although they may appear short-lived, the vortex is still alive at the end of this movie. Even though there is hardly any azimuthal contrast in the gas, there would still be a significant contrast in the dust from the point when the first vortex forms through the entire rest of the movie. Why do these vortices re-form? In order for a vortex to re-form, there must be a sharp bump in the crticial function shown in the radial profiles. Interestingly, after the initial vortex spreads into a ring, a new subtle bump in the critical function forms not at the pressure bump, but several scale heights inside the pressure bump. This subtle bump is able to trigger a new vortex at the pressure bump, but only because the separation isn't that large. If the planet were more massive, the subtle bump would be located in the same place while the pressure bump would be further away from the planet. As a result, a Jupiter-mass planet would not be able to re-trigger a vortex.</p>

				        <p>If you look at the vortex total dust lifetimes again though, the vortices in discs with large scale height also "live longer" with lower planet masses. The reason is an entirely different pathway shown below.</p>

						<p>In the H/R = 0.08 cases with a high disc mass, the vortex never stops growing. Eventually, it grows enough to transition from elongated (minimum Rossby number > -0.15) to compact (minimum Rossby number < -0.15), where what separates these two states is the Rossby number of the vortex moreso than the extent. Furthermore, the compact vortex has much stronger spiral waves that can cause the vortex to lose angular momentum and shrink until the initial pressure bump depletes. After the pressure bump disappears, the vortex migrates outwards towards the new pressure bump. Meanwhile, a second vortex forms near the planet where a new bump in the critical function arose. This process happens much slower with less massive planets, allowing the initial vortex to stay where it formed for much longer (albeit, the initial vortex survives for at least 10000 orbits regardless of planet mass, just not near the planet).</p>

						<p>Models for the two types of vortices are shown below.</p>

				        <p>Now that we better understand how vortices can form and evolve, we went back to exploring what these vortices should look like in dust observations. Instead of just initializing the dust to a power-law profile, we applied an exponential cutoff so that the vortex wasn't constantly being fed with dust. This model better matches observations where crescent-shaped features are typically the outermost feature of a disk. We found that when cutting off the dust supply, the mm-sized dust can change shape from "elongated" to "compact" and back. It could also split into "double peaks" as it circulates through the vortex.</p>

				        <p>Moreover, the H/R = 0.08 cases with two vortices could potentially resemble disks like MWC 758.</p>

				          <i> Example synthetic images.
				          <strong>Top:</strong> H/R = 0.06 with a limited supply of dust. The vortex can appear compact, elongated, or have two peaks.
				          <strong>Bottom:</strong> H/R = 0.08 with our new pathway. The vortex can shrink from elongated to compact, and later there can be two vortices in the outer disk at once.

					    <h2>Condensed summary</h2>

						<p>I study how to find evidence of planets forming around other stars. We want to know how the planets in our solar system formed but we can’t go back in time to see them form. Our only option is to look for planets around other stars that are much younger than the Sun. Although these planets are too far away to see, we can see giant planet-forming disks around these stars. For my research, I run simulations of these disks to find ways of knowing if planets we can’t see are forming in disks around young stars.</p>
