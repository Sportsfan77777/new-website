						<p>The Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-mm Array (ALMA) has revolutionized the field of planet formation with its amazing capability to take good images of nearby protoplanetary disks! (Most of the closest ones are 140 to 160 pc away.) What would you expect these disks to look like? You might expect something like the figure below on the left: a disk that fades far from the star, that also has some rings and gaps, and that the gaps might contain planets. The feature you would probably take most for granted is that the disk is axisymmetric. However, not all disks we have imaged have that last, <i>most obivous</i> feature.</p>

				          <i><strong>Left:</strong> AS 209, a normal axisymmetric disk highlighted by rings and gaps (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...869L..48G/abstract">Guzmán+ 2018</a>). <strong>Right:</strong> HD 135344B, an unusual asymmetric disk with a large crescent-shaped feature that stands out the most (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...619A.161C/abstract">Cazzoletti+ 2018</a>).</i>
				        </font></center></p>

				        <p>What is causing the crescent-shaped feature above on the right? How about a planet? As the movie below on the left shows, placing a Jupiter-mass planet in a smooth disk will create a gap in the disk. If the disk has sufficiently low viscosity, it will become unstable. The instability manifests as a series of small co-orbital vortices. In time, these vortices will merge into one big vortex that looks like the crescent in HD 135344B at the beginning. This vortex survives several thousand planet orbits, thereby providing a suitable explanation for that crescent (according to previous work).</p>

				        </font></center></p>

				    	<p>But wait a minute: How could you ever have a fully-grown Jupiter-mass planet in a smooth disk with no gap? After reasoning that doesn't make sense if the planet formed through core accretion, we tried introducing the planet more slowly over a timescale of several hundred to a few thousand orbits (see the movie above on the right for an example). We found that the vortex is much weaker in two very noticeable ways! First, the lifetime is much shorter (by 80% in the two movies shown above!). Second, the vortex is much more elongated (with an azimuthal extent of 240 degrees, instead of 120 degrees with rapid growth!). In some cases with higher viscosity than shown in the movies above, the slower growth inhibits the formation of vortices altogether!</p>

				          </i>
				        </font></center></p>

				    	<p>The figures above show how vortex lifetimes get shorter (left) and vortex extents get wider (right) with longer growth timescales. For the cases where vortices are much wider, do they look different from the normal, more compact vortices in observations of the dust too? To understand that, you'll have to check out my next paper (see the next section)!</p>

				    	<p><i><strong>Bonus:</strong> Why does the disk become unstable (and form vortices)?</i></p>
				    	<p element style="margin-top:-20px"><i>Imagine the Earth's atmosphere. Imagine that it was denser at the top than the bottom. If that were actually the case, it would become unstable and the top layers would sink down until every given layer was less dense than the layer below. Protoplanetary disks are similar: If the disk was denser further from the star than closer, it would become unstable until that were no longer the case.</i></p>
				    	<p element style="margin-top:-25px"><i>There is one major caveat to that explanation: <strong>The disk rotates!</strong> The disk's rotation stabilizes it against the layers simply "sinking towards the star." However, the disk can still become unstable. While the axisymmetric mode (m = 0) is stable, non-axisymmetric modes (m = 3 to 5 in particular) are still unstable. These modes allow the initial 3 to 5 vortices to grow in the disk before they merge into one big vortex.</i></p>
				    	<p element style="margin-top:-25px"><i>When do you get this positive density gradient in the disk? In a smooth disk, you do not. However, gap-opening planets can create positive density gradients at both of their gap edges. This is where the disk becomes unstable (to what is called the Rossby Wave instability).</i></p>

				    	<p element style="margin-top:-25px"><i>(Technically, the Earth's atmosphere rotates too and isn't any different. But I find this instability easier to think about in the atmosphere than in disks.)</i></p>

						<p>The previous section showed that elongated vortices induced by slowly-grown planets look different from concentrated vortices induced by rapidly-grown planets in the gas. But what about the dust, the component that is observed by ALMA? Naively, you might think the answer is no. Vortices trap dust at the center regardless of their shapes, right? As it turns out you would be wrong. The figure below shows why.</p>

						<center>
						<p><img src="images/research/vorticity_comparison.png" width="90%"></p>

						<p element style="margin-top:-30px"><center><font face="Arial" size=2.8>
				          <i>Comparison of concentrated and elongated vortices: vorticity and density contours.
				          <strong>Left:</strong> The concentrated vortex has a strong vorticity minimum and a series of smooth, elliptical density contours.
				          <strong>Right:</strong> The elongated vortex does not have these features.
				          </i>
				        </font></center></p>

				        <p>Above, you can see that the elongated vortex (right) lacks a vorticity minimum and a series of smooth elliptical contours, the two main features of a concentrated vortex (left) that make it straightfoward for the vortex to trap dust in its center. Instead, the elongated vortex has a much flatter pressure bump across the majority of the vortex. As a result, it doesn't have a reason to trap dust at its center. Where does the dust go instead?</p>

				          <strong>Right:</strong> Movie showing dust circulation.
				          </i>
				        </font></center></p>

				        <p>As the figure and movie above both show, the elongated vortex still easily traps dust. But instead of ending up at the center, the dust <strong>circulates</strong> around the vortex! As a result, elongated vortices are just about as elongated in the dust as they are in the gas. Another key signature of these vortices is that the peak dust concentration is typically located off-center, often by more than 30 degrees! Let's compare synthetic images of both concentrated and elongated vortices to the ALMA image of HD 135344B at the top of the page.</p>


				        <p><i><strong>Bonus:</strong> What beam diameter do I need to detect signatures of elongated vortices?</i></p>
				    	<p element style="margin-top:-20px"><i>That's a good question. The figure below shows a comparison of synthetic images of the same snapshot of an elongated vortex with three different beam sizes: half the planet's semimajor axis, equal to the planet's semimajor axis, and one and a half times the planet's semimajor axis (equivalent to about the vortex's semimajor axis). The first two beam sizes seem sufficient for a face-on disk, while the last one is not good enough. That statement is quantified in the paper.</i></p>

						<h2>For the public:</h2>

					    <h2>Condensed summary</h2>

						<p>I study how to find evidence of planets forming around other stars. We want to know how the planets in our solar system formed but we can’t go back in time to see them form. Our only option is to look for planets around other stars that are much younger than the Sun. Although these planets are too far away to see, we can see giant planet-forming disks around these stars. For my research, I run simulations of these disks to find ways of knowing if planets we can’t see are forming in disks around young stars.</p>
